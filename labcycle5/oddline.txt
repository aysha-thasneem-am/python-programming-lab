Celebrate your mother every day!

be it a working mom who juggles the responsibilities of both work and family, 

A mother plays several roles - she's a friend, a guide, and a protector.

A mother's love is unconditional - she goes above and beyond to care for her children.

Maa, Amma, Mom- countless names, but feelings it evokes are the same. Feelings of the warmth and the unconditional love.

or a stay-at-home mother-every mother is a superhuman.

She teaches you compassion, courage, forgiveness, and to have confidence and belief in yourself.
